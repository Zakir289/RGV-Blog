Among the philosophies I came across, I got more fascinated to India's Unique film maker **Ram Gopal Varma**. I don't like him as a film director rather as a Philospher. 

This is a sample Blog for him which I will extend with rich UI, in future. This is so simple application, You need just read the files through the **fs** library and just display to the user. 

In future I will adding more of his data with sections, and will host it. 


#### The sample app look like the below
